# Changelog

Notable changes to kwant, newest first. Version numbers follow the Mac app releases
([GitHub releases](https://github.com/alexsergivan/kwant/releases)). The server (`kwnt`) and the web
app ship from `main`, so changes under **Unreleased** are already on `main` but not yet in a Mac download.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Unreleased

### Added
- **Vibration on Android phones.** The web app gives a short buzz when you send a message, answer a
  question or approval card, press **Solve it**, **Done**, **Skip** or **Hand back**, and when a puzzle
  is solved, with a different buzz for errors. A bot reply arriving while the app is on screen gives a
  light double buzz, at most one per burst. A **Vibration** switch in App settings turns it off; it
  starts off when the phone asks for reduced motion. iPhones and desktops have no web vibration.

### Changed
- A bot reply that ends with a closing line such as "Anything else?", "Should I continue?" or
  "Want me to also…?" no longer pulls the person's next message back to that bot. Real questions
  ("Which city are you in?") still do, unless the next message clearly fits another bot better.
- UK places (London, Belfast, Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man) get metric units with road distances
  and speeds in miles and mph.

### Fixed
- Invisible characters (zero-width, bidi overrides, Unicode tags) are stripped from the city setting.
- A CAPTCHA step now holds the browser before the step appears, so a bot can't act on the page in between.

### Security
- Changing app-wide settings (`POST /api/settings`) is person-only. Bots change the settings they
  are allowed to through their `settings_update` action.

## [Mac 0.1.1] - 2026-10-26

### Added
- **CAPTCHA hand-off.** When a bot hits a CAPTCHA (TikTok slider, reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Cloudflare
  Turnstile and others), it stops and notifies the person. **Solve it** opens the page full screen,
  zoomed in on the puzzle, with drag, pinch and keyboard support on phones. The bot continues by itself
  once the puzzle is solved, and skips the site after a time-out (10 minutes by default, in Settings).
  No solving services, browser disguises or proxies. Ordinary "I'm not a robot" boxes and look-alike
  pop-ups don't raise a step.
- Bots see the person's time zone and city, use local units (metric outside the US, Liberia and
  Myanmar) and local sources.
- New routines report their first run in the person's time zone, for example
  "first run: Mon 26 Oct 07:00 Europe/Berlin".
- Web Push: the installed web app gets notifications while it's closed.
- Sign in from another device: one-time sign-in links, a QR code under Settings → "Add a phone or
  browser", an approve prompt on a signed-in device, and a revocable list of signed-in devices.
- People can create and regroup channels; Laya routes every new channel.
- Team-aware suggested prompts in chat.

### Changed
- The kwant.si mascot is the icon of the Mac app, its menu bar and the web app.
- The Mac install window has a light background and a drag arrow to Applications.
- A person's answer goes to the bot that asked; an @mention still wins.
- Steadier routing: Laya gets 4 s before kwant falls back to keywords (`KWNT_LAYA_TIMEOUT_MS`), every
  fallback is logged with its reason, generic verbs such as "send" no longer pick a bot, and greetings
  go to the bot that spoke last or the channel's lead.
- Every screen fits phone widths.
- The web app bundles its fonts and loads nothing from other servers.
- License: AGPL-3.0 plus commercial licenses (see [COMMERCIAL.md](COMMERCIAL.md)). Earlier versions
  stay under MIT/Apache-2.0.

### Fixed
- Handles with a dot, such as "@mr.absurdia", are no longer cut short or answered with "Not sent to …".
- Bot replies show without reopening the chat.
- `kwnt token` prints a one-time link and never the API token.

### Security
- The browser cookie folder is readable only by its owner (`0700`).

## [Mac 0.1.0] - 2026-10-25

First public release of kwant for Mac: one universal app for Apple silicon and Intel Macs (macOS 11 or
later) that runs the kwant server and its interface, with a menu-bar icon. It uses the same data folder
as `kwnt serve` (`~/.kwnt`).
